        <p>They say one needs to dress the part, and being a regular is no different. Spend some time amongst regulars in their natural habitat and observe their fashion choices. Buisness men, the alpha species of regular, will often wear a suit to scare off any predators and dominate over its prey. If you consider yourself of the dominating type, such a suit may be a viable option. But don't go too over the top, you dont want them to notice that you are not actualy a regular. </p>

        <p>The best way to be a regular, even if you are not, is to do things only a regular would do.</p>
        <p>Consider filling in some paper work or signing off on some juicey buisness deals. Set up your desk so that you are in prime view of others. After all, they will only consider you a regular if they can see your regular deeds. Place a laptop (doesn't need to be yours) in the center of the desk. If this looks too bland, spice it up with some novelty items such as an apple, a coffee cup, an important looking book, or even a spare ipad or two to make you look extra regular.</p>

        <p>Being seen eating non-regular foods could end your career as a regular instantly. Don't take that chance!</p>
        <p>Regulars eat a wide variety of foods, but the most important are the pizza, the burrito, the mega-sub, and the cake. Eat only large portion sizes. Eating smaller sizes could distinguish you as prey, which is not a desirable position to be in. Likewise, if you see someone eating smaller portion sizes, make sure to assert your dominance on them by imediately grabing their food, throwing it to the ground and screaming chicken noises at them and stomp your feet while you parade around your newly found prey.</p>
